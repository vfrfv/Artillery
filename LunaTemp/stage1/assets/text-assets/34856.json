{"id":34856,"path":"Assets\/QuickOutline\/Readme.txt","assetBundleId":-1,"data":["Readme",null,"Quick Outline\n=============\n\nDeveloped by Chris Nolet (c) 2018\n\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nTo add an outline to an object, drag-and-drop the Outline.cs\nscript onto the object. The outline materials will be loaded\nat runtime.\n\nYou can also add outlines programmatically with:\n\n    var outline = gameObject.AddComponent<Outline>();\n\n    outline.OutlineMode = Outline.Mode.OutlineAll;\n    outline.OutlineColor = Color.yellow;\n    outline.OutlineWidth = 5f;\n\nThe outline script does a small amount of work in Awake().\nFor best results, use outline.enabled to toggle the outline.\nAvoid removing and re-adding the component if possible.\n\nFor large meshes, you may also like to enable 'Precompute\nOutline' in the editor. This will reduce the amount of work\nperformed in Awake().\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf the outline appears off-center, please try the following:\n\n1. Set 'Read\/Write Enabled' on each model's import settings.\n2. Disable 'Optimize Mesh Data' in the player settings.\n"]}
